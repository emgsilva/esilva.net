I have been working with Enabling Teams and using Enabling Teams (as defined in Team Topologies) behaviors for almost ten years. From being a software engineering, architect and tech lead with a big focus on upskilling teams, to working on initiatives that empower 100+ teams, so that teams and org can achieve a faster flow of change. I also am a <a href="https://teamtopologies.com/ttvp">Team Topologies Valued Practitioner (TTVP)</a>, who works in the <a href="https://teamtopologies.com/people">Team Topologies Core Team</a> to shape ideas around all things Team Topologies, including Enabling Teams. In this page you can find different writings and resources I am creating on the topic of enabling teams.
