  <h2>What is Architecture Topologies?</h2>
  <p>Architecture Topologies is a set of thinking models and practices to help organizations understand and improve their approach to architecture. Particularly, how does the organization approach learning, design, and decision-making in its different scopes: in its teams, across the teams, and across the organization? Making this activity of improving and addressing any blockers an essential part of the organization's operating model is crucial to allow it to respond sustainably to its ever-changing context and environment.</p>

  <p>I introduced the term "Architecture Topologies" in 2021 in this <a href="https://esilva.net/tla_insights/architecture-topologies">article</a>.The name and ideas are highly inspired by Team Topologies - i.e., like Team Topologies, Architecture Topologies focus on providing a simple and representative language to understand and improve our approach to architecture to enable a sustainable fast flow of change. Since then, I have been using this model with clients and improving it with new insights and learnings.</p>

  <p>This page compiles the essential resources and materials on Architecture Topologies.</p>

  <i>(this diagram shows an example of some categories and patterns of architecture topologies - and how that can correlate with the ability of organization achieving sustainable fast flow of change, but also organization culture and structures - more details can be found on this talk at <a href="https://esilva.net/talks/#kandddinsky_2022">Kandddinksky 2022)</a></i>
