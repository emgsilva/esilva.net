<h2>What is Architecture Organization Topologies?</h2>
<p>Architecture Organization Topologies (or "Architecture Topologies" for short) is a set of thinking models and practices to help organizations understand and evolve their architectural, design, and decision-making approaches, practices, and structures. The main goal is to embrace that organizations will continuously evolve their approaches to architecture in order to allow the organization to sustainably respond to its ever-changing context and environment. I introduced the term ‚ÄúArchitecture Topologies" in 2021 in this <a href="https://esilva.net/tla_insights/architecture-topologies">article</a>]. The name and ideas are highly inspired by Team Topologies - i.e., a language to discuss how we understand and discuss the evolution of architecture approaches in organizations to enable a sustainable fast flow of change. Since then, I have continued developing this idea further and validated its need and importance in different scenarios and organizations as an essential activity to allow organizations to create a sustainable flow of change. This page will compile articles, talks and references on this topic.</p>
