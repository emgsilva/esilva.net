  <h2>What is Architecture Modernization Enabling Team (AMET)?</h2>
  <p>Architecture Modernization Enabling Team (AMET) is an Architecture Enabling Team (and Architecture Topology) that focuses on coordinating and upskilling all teams and stakeholders involved in an architecture modernization initiative. The main reason for its existence is to counter-balance and address the typical complex challenges that such modernization initiatives have. For example, the competing with people's time to address these multi-team, many months or years initiatives. This concept and pattern was originally created by myself and Nick Tune in 2023, as we observed the need for such an Enabling Team while helping multiple client organizations kickstarting their Architecture Modernization journeys. This page will compile articles, talks and references on this topic.</p>
