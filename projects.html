  <h2>Archived & Dormant Projects</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/well-rounded-product-teams">Well Rounded Product Teams</a> (<i>2019</i>): my articles and talks
      (and reference materials) on the topic of Well Rounded Product Teams</li>
    <li><a href="/everyone-architects">Everyone Architects</a> (<i>2018</i>): my articles and talks (and reference
      materials) on interesting architecture considerations to have while building software products. Nowadays teams
      own the software products they build, and consequently everyone should have a role/input on <i>the important
        decisions</i> (= "architecture") related with the project. This does not mean everyone needs to be a software
      architect, however I argue that everyone should be mindful and aware of architecture (<i>the important
        decisions</i>).</li>
