title:  "Platform Engineering Hype"
---

> this is a "quick summary" / "hot take" on some interesting ideas around "Platform Engineering". I will be writing more about this topic in the future. In particular explore sound ideas, thinking models and practices to establish platforms that truly support "sustainable fast flow of change" (as opposed to the hype approach that is too much technology-driven).

I have just watched a "masterclass" from Dave Farley (in his Continuous Delivery Youtube Channel) on the current overly hyped and poorly positioned takes on "Platform Engineering"... He brings up so many interesting points - that I have also been bringing up in many conversations. Here are a few highlights that I found very interesting.

This "modern" take on platform engineering is "technology-driven" and sells the idea of "creating the ideal platform", which is simply "impossible": we cannot just create a team that goes and "hides technology" from the teams that need to use it... and furthermore, the platform that teams need needs to be incrementally built with the teams that need it. That will inevitably lead to problems. As Dave says:

“Talking about Platform Teams as the technical teams is the wholly wrong model”.

Alternatively, embrace that "the way to get to great platforms is to evolve them from the demand of stream-aligned teams… not a technology one”.

Embrace that Platforms and Platforms teams should be instead focused on the key traits that Team Topologies defines for platform teams: reduce cognitive load; making platforms self-service; and of optional use... these traits lead to Platforms being naturally created with Stream-aligned teams and their needs, as opposed to "technology silos" that hide the wrong complexity and have the wrong abstractions.

I also love and share his take on the weird discussions that are happening around "Platform Engineering" VS {"DevOps" or "Continuous Delivery" or "SRE"}... that is just wrong and a "commercial stunt" that probably some are trying to "milk this hype"!

⭐️ His conclusion sums it all up pretty well: "A lot of the current takes on Platform Engineering is “wrong”, and in my opinion, will lead people to suffer from the same old problems of siloing development and expertize… my advice is to read the Team Topologies book on platform teams, practice continuous delivery and good engineering practices to manage the complexity of your systems and don’t buy the hype that this is some kind of brand new approach to software development"...

I fully agree with these ideas from Dave. I also propose that people look at the work and thinking of [Jabe Bloom](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jabebloom) on Platforms (also his podcast on the topic: [https://www.youtube.com/@Ergonautic](https://www.youtube.com/@Ergonautic)). For example, his great work on the "Three Economies" ([https://blog.jabebloom.com/2020/03/04/the-three-economies-an-introduction](https://blog.jabebloom.com/2020/03/04/the-three-economies-an-introduction)), which brings a level of depth and nuance to this discussion that, to me, is needed to make good progress on these discussions!
