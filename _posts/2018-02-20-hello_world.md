```scala
print("Hello World! I am back!")
```

After a few years of "downtime" (and many changes on my life/work/etc.), I am reviving [esilva.net](http://esilva.net): my website and blog.

My goal with esilva.net is to share interesting things I come across or do. Mostly, these will be things related with my day-to-day professional activities (these are my own opinions, not from my employer). Why am I doing this? Because I love to learn and am a long time note taker: love to document things I read, learn, observe, build, etc. However, those notes tend to "get lost" or be only useful for myself. I believe that is a shame, as that knowledge can be useful to others that may be facing the same challenges or are interested on similar topics.

See you soon!
