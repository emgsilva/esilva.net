After a few years, I am reviving [esilva.net](http://esilva.net), my website and blog.

My goal with esilva.net is to publish/share interesting things things I come across. Mostly, these publications will be related with my day-to-day professional activities - note: these will always be my own opinions, not related with my employer. Why am I doing this? Because I am a long time note writer (love to document things I read, learn, observe, build, etc. However, those notes tend to get lost or be only useful for myself. I believe that is a shame, as that knowledge can be made even more useful to myself (as I will have to further understand and organize it) and also to others that may be facing the same challenges or are interested on similar topics.

See you soon!
