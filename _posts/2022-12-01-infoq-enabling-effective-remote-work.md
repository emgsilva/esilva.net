title:  "Enabling Effective Remote Working - Principles and Patterns from Team Topologies (InfoQ article)"
---

I have had the pleasure of writing an article for InfoQ with [Rich Allen](https://teamtopologies.com/all-ttvp/rich-allen-ttvp) on ["Enabling Effective Remote Working - Principles and Patterns from Team Topologies"](https://www.infoq.com/articles/remote-working-team-topologies/).

This article combines a lot of learnings and discussions I have had with Rich (also experiences we have observed with our clients) and with [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/) authors over the past two years. In particular, we emphasize the need for more deliberate and explicit attention to designing structures that enable healthy and scalable dynamics and interactions for teams working in remote settings. This is also the case for non-remote (which are becoming rare nowadays) or hybrid settings. Nevertheless, they become vital in remote settings.

We touch on three major topics: team boundaries, team dependencies, and purposeful interactions, sharing several principles and patterns on those. We also share examples and practical tools that teams and organizations can start using. These topics are covered more extensively in the Team Topologies book and the [Team Topologies Remote Interactions Workbook](https://teamtopologies.com/workbook) (and in several other publications and discussions we have worked on over the last few years).
