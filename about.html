  <p>I am an independent consultant, trainer, coach, and advisor on topics related to the sustainable evolution of sociotechnical systems, organizational design, and enabling technical leadership & (software) architecture. I have a solid academic background (PhD in Computer Science) and hands-on experience in designing and building software-based products and the organizations needed to support their sustainable evolution (strategies, teams, capabilities, platforms, etc.).</p>

  <p>Since 2005 I have done a wide range of things: university researcher and teacher; consultant; trainer; tech lead; engineer and architect of software products. I spent 3 years working on my startup, as founder, CEO, lead engineer, and consultant (the startup was created from the outcomes of my PhD thesis research). From 2017 to 2022 I was a Principal Tech Lead at <a href="https://bol.com">bol.com</a> the biggest online retailer in the Netherlands and Belgium, where I led and participated in multiple key initiatives (such as the transformation of data science from a central department into a ‚Äúdiscipline‚Äù; transformation into a product-led organization (35+ products, 160+ product teams); and kickstarting and leading of the Tech Leads Network - a network of 35+ Tech Leads of the different products in the organizations).</p>

  <p>Currently, I am working as an Independent Consultant. My mission is to help Tech-enabled organizations to achieve (more) sustainable co-evolution of their teams/org and technical systems - driven by customer and business goals. I coach, train, advise and consult with organizations to help them understand, orient, and shape ways to navigate and ‚Äúskill up‚Äù in these topics. I use different methods and techniques, such as Team Topologies (for which I am Valued Practitioner - TTVP), Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Wardley Mapping, and Product Thinking, among other things. Furthermore, I research, write, and often give talks on these topics (find more about it on <a href="http://esilva.net">esilva.net</a>).
