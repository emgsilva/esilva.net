  <p>I am an independent consultant, trainer, coach, and advisor on sociotechnical system evolution, architecture, and leadership. I have a solid academic background (Ph.D. in Computer Science). I also have hands-on experience designing and building software-based products and the organizations and teams behind them.</p>

  <p>Since 2005 I have done a wide range of things. I have been a university researcher and teacher; consultant; trainer; tech lead; engineer, and architect of software products. I spent three years working on my startup as founder, CEO, lead engineer, and consultant. From 2017 to 2022, I was a Principal Tech Lead at <a href="https://bol.com">bol.com</a>, the biggest online retailer in the Netherlands and Belgium. There I led and participated in multiple vital initiatives, such as the transformation of data science from a central department into a ‚Äúdiscipline‚Äù; transformation into a product-led organization (35+ products, 160+ product teams); and kickstarting and leading the Tech Leads Network - a network of 35+ Tech Leads in and across all the different products in the organizations).</p>
  
  <p>Currently, I am working as an independent consultant. My mission is to help tech-enabled organizations achieve a sustainable fast flow of change. I take a sociotechnical framing, i.e., a co-evolution of teams/org and technical systems - driven by customers, environment, and business goals. I coach, train, advise and consult with organizations to help them understand, orient, and shape options and ways to navigate and ‚Äúskill up‚Äù in these topics. I use different methods and techniques to do this. For example, Team Topologies (for which I am a <a href="https://teamtopologies.com/ttvp">Valued Practitioner - TTVP</a>), Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Wardley Mapping, and Product Thinking, among other things. I research, write, and often give talks on these topics (find more information on <a href="http://esilva.net">esilva.net</a>).</p>
  
  <p>I am originally from Portugal but now live in Amsterdam, Netherlands.</p>
