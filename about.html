<p>My name is Eduardo da Silva. I am a senior software engineer/architect/tech-lead with a solid academic background (PhD in Computer Science) and hands-on experience on designing and building software products.</p>

<p>Since 2005 I have done a wide range of things: university researcher and teacher; consultant; trainer; tech lead; engineer and architect of software products. Furthermore, I was also founder, CEO and lead engineer of a startup company (created from the results of my PhD thesis research).</p>

<p>Currently I am working as tech lead and software architect. This involves hands-on technical design, research, architecture and development. However, it also/especially entails a lot of work with teams/people, building the technical community and platform to enable us to move at "high velocity" (= high speed + direction). I am doing this on the context of teams building data science powered products (maturing the technical community and platform for this new capability to build products).</p> 

<p>On my free time I love to play futsal (though have not played so much lately...), watch good movies and read.</p>
