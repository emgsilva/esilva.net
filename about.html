  <p>I am a (Software) Tech Leader and Sociotechnical Architect with a solid academic background (PhD in Computer Science) and hands-on experience on (co-)designing and building software-based products and organizations (strategies, teams, capabilities, platforms, etc.).</p>

  <p>Since 2005 I have done a wide range of things: university researcher and teacher; consultant; trainer; tech lead; engineer and architect of software products. Furthermore, I spent 3 years working on my own startup, as founder, CEO and lead engineer (this startup was created from the results of my PhD thesis research).</p>
  
  <p>Currently I am working as Tech Leader and Sociotechnical Architect. This involves hands-on technical design, research, architecture and development. However, it also entails a lot of organizational design and strategy (e.g.: making sure the right team topologies are set up, the right enabling teams are in place, etc.). I am really invested on combining the architecting & scaling of technical and organizational systems (a.k.a. Sociotechnical Architecture), as in my view they need to go hand-in-hand to enable maximizing overall effectiveness and impact on building the best (system &) product for customers.</p>
  
  <p>On my free time I love to play futsal, watch good movies and read.</p>
