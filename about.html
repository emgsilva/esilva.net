  <p>I am an independent consultant, trainer, coach, and advisor on enabling sociotechnical leadership & systems evolution topics. I have a solid academic background (Ph.D. in Computer Science) and hands-on experience designing and building software-based products and the organizations behind those great products.</p>

  <p>Since 2005 I have done a wide range of things. I have been a university researcher and teacher; consultant; trainer; tech lead; engineer, and architect of software products. I spent three years working on my startup as founder, CEO, lead engineer, and consultant. From 2017 to 2022, I was a Principal Tech Lead at <a href="https://bol.com">bol.com</a>, the biggest online retailer in the Netherlands and Belgium. There I led and participated in multiple vital initiatives, such as the transformation of data science from a central department into a “discipline”; transformation into a product-led organization (35+ products, 160+ product teams); and kickstarting and leading the Tech Leads Network - a network of 35+ Tech Leads of the different products in the organizations).</p>

  <p>Currently, I am working as an independent consultant. My mission is to help tech-enabled organizations to achieve (more) sustainable co-evolution of their teams/org and technical systems - driven by customer and business goals. I coach, train, advise and consult with organizations to help them understand, orient, and shape ways to navigate and “skill up” in these topics. I use different methods and techniques to do this, for example, Team Topologies (for which I am <a href="https://teamtopologies.com/partner-types/team-topologies-valued-practitioner-ttvp">Valued Practitioner - TTVP</a>), Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Wardley Mapping, and Product Thinking, among other things. Furthermore, I research, write, and often give talks on these topics (find more information on <a href="http://esilva.net">esilva.net</a>).

  <p>Eduardo is originally from Portugal but now lives in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.</p>
