    <h2>⚠️ Are you facing challenges around:</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b>lacking good approaches and practices to facilitate architecture modernization?</b></li>
      <li><b>expensive and long modernization projects with a high failure rate?</b></li>
      <li><b>very slow modernization efforts due to unclear vision and ownership of activities?</b></li>
      <li><b>many teams involved but most lacking the skill to facilitate the modernization initiative?</b></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>🟠 If these questions resonate with you, your organization is lacking good skills on facilitating architecture modernization - and most likely also need to improve your organization's architectural capabilities.</p>
    <p>🟢 This is where I can help you and your change agents with my "Effective Facilitation of Architecture Modernization" workshops and sessions. <b>These are designed to help up-skill change agents, architects - and teams - involved in architecture modernization efforts, so modernization efforts are more effective and the overall organization's architectural capability improves overtime.</b></p>

  <a name="why"></a>
  <h2>⭐️ Why</h2>

  <p>Because architecture modernization efforts are complex. Ideally, these efforts should be driven by the people on the teams involved. However, in practice we know that they tend to get stuck if no one facilitates these initiatives.</p>

  <p>This is why I have developed this workshop and coaching offer: I want to help you maximize your ability to successfully facilitate architecture modernization efforts and also enable you to create structures and dynamics that allow the overall organization architectural capability to continuously improve and evolve.</p>


  <br>
  <a name="what"></a>
  <h2>ℹ️ What</h2>

  <p>In these workshop sessions I will introduce you to different ideas, methods and techniques that should help accelerate your journey towards a more effective facilitation of architecture modernization initiatives. From getting a good understanding of the sociotechnical context, i.e., understand not only the technical challenge but also the organizational/teams challenges; to the kickstarting of a modernization initiative (with the key people and focus); to the actual execution of the modernization initiative (following ideas, such as the <a href="https://esilva.net/articles/architecture-modernization-enabling-team">Architecture Modernization Enabling Team (AMET)</a>). The idea is that this helps up-skill change agents facilitating architecture modernization. They become more equipped to address those challenges, and furthermore help the organization continuously improve its architecture capability - in particular the teams close to the problems.</p>

  <p>I will share a lot of ideas, examples, methods and techniques. However, participants will be driving many of the discussions and exercises, so that we can maximize learning for all the participants.</p>

  <br>
  <a name="whom"></a>
  <h2>👤 Who should attend</h2>

  <p>Anyone involved with architecture modernization initiatives. You may be a CTO, VP of Engineering or Product, Architect, Tech Lead, Product Manager, Engineering manager, Staff Engineer, and anyone from teams who want to improve their skills to approach architecture modernization efforts.</p>

  <p>I can give this workshop to groups facilitating a particular modernization initiative; or in general to groups in the company that are to work on different modernization efforts.</p>

  <p>💡 These workshops and coaching sessions can also be interesting for consulting companies that want to improve their strategy on how to help clients on their architecture modernization initiatives - following an Enabling Thinking approach.</p>
