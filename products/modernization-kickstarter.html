  <p><b>ℹ️ Multi-month program with several activities to understand, orient and kickstart your architecture & teams/organization modernization. After the initial phase of understanding and identifying options, I focus on day-to-day enabling support to help you effectively start the flywheel of modernization and improvement activities. I do this together with your teams, leaders and the "modernization enabling team" - group of people in your organization that will be making sure that the modernization efforts are happening and are aligned with your strategic goals.</b></p>

  <h2>Examples of Modernization Kickstarter Program</h2>
  
  <p>[2022 - 2025] <b>Circle K eMobility Organization</b> - Modernization of technical systems and Product and Technology teams, from silos to effective cross-functional value streams. This is a multi-year journey, with a lot of activities with teams and leaders to identify the important value streams, and then re-organize teams (with all of the necessary skills/capabilities) to own, refactor, evolve and scale the important products and systems in those value streams.</p>
