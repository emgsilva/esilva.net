    <h2>⚠️ Are you facing challenges around:</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b>learning new technologies or methods essential to help your teams work better?</b></li>
      <li><b>having many teams "reinventing the wheel" because there is no time nor structures to effective learn from each other?</b></li>
      <li><b>teams continuing adding accidental complexity - because they have no time to learn?</b></li>
      <li><b>needing experts to jump from project to project ("firefighting") and becoming a dependency for many teams?</b></li>
      <li><b>lack of good strategies to onboard new capabilities (ML/AI, Continuous Delivery, Product Management, Cloud, etc.)?</b></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>🟠 If these questions resonate with you, your organization's approach to learning and addressing missing capabilities is lacking.</p>
    <p>🟢 This is where I can help you with the "Effective Enabling Teams" (and effective Team  Topologies) workshops and sessions. <b>These are designed to help you to improve the way your organization leverages Enabling Teams (and Enabling Thinking) in order to be more effective on learning missing skills or carry out the necessary developments to onboard new strategic capabilities.</b></p>

  <a name="why"></a>
  <h2>⭐️ Why</h2>

  <p>Because organizations can improve their effectiveness and return on investment when they leverage Enabling Teams and Enabling Thinking strategically.</p>
  
  <p>Enabling Teams is one of the most misunderstood Team Topologies fundamental team types. Organizations often think they are a waste of money as they are not directly producing product features. However, this is a rather naive thinking, as by adopting Enabling Teams to help addressing your most relevant challenges (in particular ones that many teams are facing - e.g., missing skills or capabilities), you can leverage their multiplying effect. With this you avoid waste and unnecessary complexity & technical debt, since you avoid having many teams solving the same problems sub-optimally. Instead, you empower your experts and pioneers to help facilitate all of those teams on adopting the most appropriate approaches for their challenges. This is fundamental to help organizations navigate the fast-moving environments they exist - namely: how to enable people in the org and teams to be more effective "faster", and with that achieve a faster and more sustainable flow of change.</p>
