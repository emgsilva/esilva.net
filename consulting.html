      <font color="#ff8000">üåü[<b>June 2023</b>] new Team Topologies Academy video course <a href="https://esilva.net/articles/effective-enabling-teams-course">"Effective Enabling Teams"</a>. This course helps understand the importance of Enabling Teams and how to kickstart and scale them to support a sustainable fast flow of change and value in an org.</font>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>üõ† Approach:</b> I coach, train, advise and consult to help you define ways to navigate and "skill up" in these core areas required to sustainably evolve your tech-enabled organization. This can be a short consulting session, multi-day immersive workshop (collective experience to understand and orient to successfully "kickstarting" a modernization initiative), or longer-term engagement - where I can help you assess & understand where you are, how to start moving and also help/coach you and your teams on adopting and changing key elements that help you to achieve a more sustainable co-evolution of your teams/org & tech systems. I like to call that "Enabling Tech Leadership", i.e.: shifting from classical hierarchies and bureaucratic structures, to enabling structures where we aim at maximizing teams ability and potential. You can find more details on the specific services and activities I provide on each of the pages of the areas. If you think I can help and we should collaborate, don't hesitate on <a href="mailto:eduardo@esilva.net">contacting me</a>.</p><br>
